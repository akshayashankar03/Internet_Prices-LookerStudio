Looker Studio is a powerful data visualization tool that allows to create interactive dashboards and reports. In this case, we will use Looker Studio to analyze internet prices and usage across different countries.

First, A geo chart that shows internet plans for different countries. This chart will allows to see the availability and prices of internet plans across the globe with drop-down list for country and continental regions to easily filter the data.

Next, A bar chart that shows the cheapest rate of 1GB of data in USD for each country. This chart will allows to compare the prices of internet plans across different countries and see which countries offer the most affordable rates.

A pie chart that shows the percentage of internet users in different countries. This chart will allows to see which countries have the highest number of internet users.

Additionally, A tree map that shows the countries with the most expensive rates for 1GB of data. This chart will allows to see which countries have the highest internet prices.

Finally, A dynamic line chart that shows the average price of 1GB of data in 2020 and 2021. This chart will allows to see how the prices of internet plans have changed over time.

All of these charts can be customized to fit our needs, and Looker Studio makes it easy to share our findings with others. By using Looker Studio, we can gain insights into internet prices and usage across different countries and make informed decisions about your internet plan. It has powerful mapping capabilities, which allow you to visualize internet prices and usage across different regions or even at the neighborhood level. This can provide a more detailed understanding of internet prices and usage patterns in specific areas and also allows you to collaborate with others and share your findings easily. You can create interactive dashboards that allow others to explore the data on their own, or you can create reports and visualizations that can be exported and shared with others.
